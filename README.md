## Todo

- Add music, an icon and a background
- Fix bugs
- Improve the result section formatting to closer resemble the original games
- Add a reset button that restarts the process
- Change the font
- Add more animation
- Full script for results needs to be implemented

## Known issues

- There's a tendancy for a single duplicate question to be picked, this is unintended behaviour
- On rare occasions, the selected result will become undefined stopping the process
